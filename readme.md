# Yep, it's pretty empty in here #

but don't worry, it'll grow

### Gimme high level ###
This project started out being a device library for driving more than your average leds I had started to learn about microcontrollers namely the netduino. Most of the work has been put into supporting libraries thus far. The focus right now is around touch a touch screen from adafruit(ILI9341 240x320 capacitive touch) and will continue focused in this direction until a substantial graphics library is established that can drive more than one display. I am interested in audio devices and will likely start building on audio devices after.

### Whats in here for me? ###
well, a bunch of unfinished undocumented code just like a bunch of other repositories out there. I will come back to this readme and add a list of devices that I would consider finished and useful at some point, for now you can take a look at the pdxbytes.Devices lib to see what is supported currently.
